# CHPastel vscode
This is VSCode theme based of [CHPastel colour scheme](https://caasi.dev/post/chpastel/). It is heavily inspired by [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) by [Ethan Schoonover](https://ethanschoonover.com/).

Solarized colour scheme is great and it was created with a purpose that was working for me for a very long time (around 5 years), however, I started to appreciate darker themes.

Yes there are a lot of different variations available out there, but they are usually to close to the original, or to contrasty.
